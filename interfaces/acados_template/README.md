acados_template is an (experimental) Python package that can be used to specify optimal control problems from Python and to generate self-contained C code that uses the acados solvers to solve them. The framework is based on templated C files which are rendered from Python using the templating engine Jinja2. Notice that, at the moment only few options are supported. 

## usage
You can check out the examples folder to learn about  how to use acados_template. First of all, you need to compile and install acados without the qpDUNES, HPMPC and OSQP QP solvers running 'cmake -DACADOS_WITH_QPDUNES=OFF -DACADOS_WITH_HPMPC=OFF -DACADOS_WITH_OSQP=OFF .. & make install' Then, you will need to install acados_template Python package by running 'pip install .' from the root folder. You should now be able to import it as a Python module and specify the problem formulation as in examples/<example_name>/generate_c_code.py
